Hello fellow Earthlings,

My name is Niharika. I'd describe myself as an introvert who is also a coding and lawn tennis addict! It's my bread and butter. The reason for my survival on our planet. Passion drives me to do things even I wouldn't expect myself to. I just want to live my life doing whatever I'm passioate about at that point of time.
