Hello fellow Earthlings,

My name is Niharika. I'd describe myself as an introvert who is also a coding and lawn tennis addict! It's my bread and butter, the reason for my survival on our planet. Passion drives me to do things even I wouldn't expect myself to. I plan on spending my life chasing my passions, no matter how wild!
